## Greetings! Good to see you here.
Every software engineer I see out in the world seems to have a github page.
Didn't see too many for hardware engineers.<br />
Thought this could be one of them.

## Background
I'm an ASIC Design Engineer who develops RTL.
It seems to help that I have a Master's from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) and a Bachelor's from [PESIT](https://www.pes.edu/), both in ECE.
When not designing digital logic blocks, I like to play and watch a lot of sports (badminton, soccer, cricket), sing and play the piano, draw and paint, read fiction and spend time outdoors (running, hiking, surfing).<br />
Oh, I like to cook too. Need to fuel the engine that tries to write code, right?

## How to reach out to me?
